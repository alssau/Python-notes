# Crashing consequences.

Can get error 98 if the script returns error and the local server doesnt shut down properly. You can use:

sudo lsof -i :5000 #to detect the process listening on the port, and then
sudo kill -9 <process_id> #to actually stop the process running on the port


# Stop the server.

Use control + c to stop it.
